# Horror-Club

Solo re-write of a Founders & Coders group project.

The [original site](https://github.com/fac-12/HorrorNightMovies) was built using Node, Express, Handlebars and Postgres.

This version makes use of Express and Postgres on the back end, but uses React, Redux and React Router on the front end.
